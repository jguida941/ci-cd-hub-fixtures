# Python Failing Fixture Dependencies
# Some packages here have KNOWN VULNERABILITIES for testing pip-audit/Trivy

# Testing
pytest>=7.4.0
pytest-cov>=4.1.0
hypothesis>=6.92.0

# Type checking
mypy>=1.8.0

# Linting/formatting (for local dev)
ruff>=0.1.9
black>=23.12.0
isort>=5.13.0

# NOTE: Security tools (bandit, pip-audit) are NOT included here because they
# conflict with the intentionally vulnerable dependencies below.
# The workflow installs these tools separately.

# Mutation testing - also installed by workflow but no conflicts
mutmut>=3.0.0

# Note: The code in this fixture has intentional security issues
# that Bandit and Semgrep will detect (hardcoded passwords, eval, etc.)
